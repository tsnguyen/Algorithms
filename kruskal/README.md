Kruskal's algorithm...
==========
... to find the minimum spanning tree of connected graphs.

The files are
  * main.cpp: the main program that generates random graphs and tests the 
    algorithm
  * implementation of the Kruskal's algorithm using heap sort and tree
  * heap.h and heap.cpp: the heap data structure, used to sort the edges
  * tree.h and tree.cpp: the tree class, or graph with no loop
  * graph.h and graph.cpp: the graph class
  * unionfind.h and unionfind.cpp: the union-find data structure, used to 
  keep track of the clusters in the tree graphs.
